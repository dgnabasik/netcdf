    "long_description": "This data package contains measured time series data for several small businesses and residential households relevant for household- or low-voltage-level power system modeling. The data includes solar power generation as well as electricity consumption (load) in a resolution up to single device consumption. The starting point for the time series, as well as data quality, varies between households, with gaps spanning from a few minutes to entire days. All measurement devices provided cumulative energy consumption/generation over time. Hence overall energy consumption/generation is retained, in case of data gaps due to communication problems. Measurements were conducted 1-minute intervals, with all data made available in an interpolated, uniform and regular time interval. All data gaps are either interpolated linearly, or filled with data of prior days. Additionally, data in 15 and 60-minute resolution is provided for compatibility with other time series data. Data processing is conducted in Jupyter Notebooks/Python/pandas.",
